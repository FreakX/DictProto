DictProto

- Easy Dictionary Protocol -

#After youve loaded the DictProto library,
#you have to initialize a DictProto socket.


import DictProto
socket = DictProto.Socket(DictProto.SERVER_SOCK  # For the server or::
			  DictProto.CLIENT_SOCK, # For the Client
			  6724,			 # Port (Server and Client)
			  "127.0.0.1"		 # Host (Only Client)
			  )

#After You have initialized the server socket, you can listen on it.

socket.Listen()	

#The Socket listens for a Client, until a Client connects

#Then You can Send, or Receive Dictionarys.

#Server:
print socket.Receive()

#Client:
socket.Send({"CMD" : "Hi"})

#Server Shell:
{"CMD" : "Hi"}
